# Contribution Guidelines
- Take a look at the [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for missing features/current bugs.
- New features should be added as a Cog module, which are then loaded automatically when the bot starts up. You can read more about Cogs in [Discord.py documentations](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/api.html#cogs).
